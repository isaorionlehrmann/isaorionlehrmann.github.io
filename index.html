		<p>ABOUT ME PROJECTS CONTACT</p>

		<p><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></p>

		<p>Hello! My name is Isa, but I go by my middle name Orion. I’m a student, programmer, surfer, skater, artist, and music addict.</p>

		<p><strong>STUDENT</strong></p>

		<p>I’m a third year student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. On this website, you can find ways of contacting me. Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in working with me!</p>

		<p><strong>PROGRAMMER</strong></p>

		<P>I want to become the best programmer I can become, and would enjoy any opportunity to learn more and improve my skills. Here, you can find projects I have worked on.</P>

		<p><strong>SURFER/SKATER/ARTIST/MUSIC ADDICT</strong></p>

		<p>Outside of academics and programming, my greatest joys are surfing and skating with my friends, listening to/making music, and creating different kinds of video edits. I also live for having quality time with my family and friends- exploring and experiencing as many things with them that I can. I just want to live the most fulfilling of a life I can!</p>

		<p>Here are some pictures to illustrate!</p>
